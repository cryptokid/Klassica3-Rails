== Klassica3

Klassica is an open-source Classified Ads Platform developed by Arthur Ketcham. It has been running at Walla Walla University (http://klassica.wallawalla.edu) since 2007. Klassica is owned and managed by Kaskadia Software Studios and is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version3.

This version (version 3) is a much needed Ruby-on-Rails port of the aging and rusty version 2, which was authored in PHP 5.
This is a work in progress, and is currently under development. We will update this information as it becomes closer to release.
